                      CrewU is a current project that is meant to teach incoming and current Crew members the basics of Linux and Web Development. The project is broken down into 4 parts: Linux Basics, Linux Advanced, Linux Infrastructure, and Web Development.

                    <p>
                      Started in the late 20th century, this is Crew's biggest project. It encompasses several rewrites using the latest technology available at the time. From PowerPoint to Python to Puppet, this project is all about controlling the TV screens around campus. Using a centralized DDS server, users can modify slides on any TV at any point in time, and even put up dynamic slides to show things like print queues or RSS feeds.

                    <p>
                      Metrics is all about harnessing the data that can be collected from systems in the labs. The initial premise is to see what machines are more popular in 102 West Village H (the computer lab), Linux or Windows. If you're all about proving Linux is the superior OS, stop by and work on this project to prove it. If you do prove it, then we get even more Linux machines in the lab!
