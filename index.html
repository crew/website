	<h2>We're a group of students that hack on cool projects to make our college a better place.</h2>
	<p>We work on stuff that ranges from web development to infrastructure to cloud computing, so if you're interested in any or all of the above definitely consider getting involved. Visit our <a href="/projects">projects</a> page to check out some of the things we've done.</p>
